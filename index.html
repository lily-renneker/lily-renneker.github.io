      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Lily Renneker, a Computational and Applied Mathematics student at Colorado School of Mines, graduating in May 2025. I'm passionate about data science, mathematical modeling, and the intersection of mathematics and biology. Throughout my academic career, I've been particularly interested in using mathematical techniques to model real-world systems, from biology to data analysis.</p>
      <p>In addition to my studies, I am actively involved in organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers, Society of Women in Mathematics, and OSTEM. These groups have provided me with opportunities to contribute to promoting diversity and inclusion within STEM fields.</p>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy engaging in various creative and analytical projects, from dance choreography to tackling complex mathematical problems. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills in applied mathematics and data science to contribute to research and applications that address key challenges in the healthcare and biotechnology sectors.</p>
