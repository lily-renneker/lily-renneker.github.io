      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Lily Renneker and welcome to my project portfolio!</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from Colorado School of Mines with a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics, and I’m now pursuing my M.S. in Applied Mathematics with a focus in data science at the University of Colorado Denver. My goal is to apply data-driven methods and mathematical modeling to tackle real-world challenges from finance, to biotech, to math education.</p>
      <p>During undergrad, I worked on a variety of projects with many different applications, from mathematical biology to climate change to finance prediction models. In the summer between my junior and senior year, as a Managed Application Services Intern at RSM US LLP, I built data automation tools within Microsoft Dynamics 365, reducing processing errors and streamlining batch tracking.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, I’m especially motivated to contribute to biotechnology and personalized medicine, using data science to improve outcomes for underrepresented communities. I’m also passionate about making mathematics more inclusive and accessible through research and education.</p>
      <p>Beyond academics and research, I’ve been involved with the Society of Women Engineers, Society for Women in Mathematics, and OSTEM. These communities have been vital in helping me advocate for diversity in STEM and connect with others who share my values.</p>
