      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Lily Renneker, a Computational and Applied Mathematics student at Colorado School of Mines, graduating in May 2025. I'm passionate about data science, mathematical modeling, and the intersection of mathematics and biology. Throughout my academic career, I've been particularly interested in using mathematical techniques to model real-world systems, from biology to data analysis.</p>
      <p>In addition to my studies, I am actively involved in organizations such as the Society of Women Engineers, Society of Women in Mathematics, and OSTEM. These groups have provided me with opportunities to contribute to promoting diversity and inclusion within STEM fields.</p>
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy engaging in various creative and analytical projects, from dance choreography to tackling complex mathematical problems. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills in applied mathematics and data science to contribute to research and applications that address key challenges in the healthcare and biotechnology sectors.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>Time Delay Diabetes Model | MATH 431 - Mathematical Biology</h3>
    <p>This project aims to improve a differential equation model of insulin-glucose regulation in Type 1 Diabetes. I incorporated time-delay differential equations to simulate physiological lags in insulin secretion and glucose absorption.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Methods:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented a glucose-dependent Hill function to represent nonlinear insulin response.</li>
        <li>Used MATLAB to simulate system dynamics and phase plane analysis.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Results:</strong> Successfully replicated the oscillatory dynamics seen in clinical glucose-insulin interactions. Identified areas for model improvement and proposed adjustments to better align with biological data.</p>
    <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
    <pre><code>
% Differential equation for insulin-glucose regulation
% Function for glucose absorption
function dGdt = glucoseDynamics(t, G, I)
    alpha = 0.05; % Insulin sensitivity
    beta = 0.1; % Glucose absorption rate
    dGdt = beta * (I - G);
end

    <h3>Denver Rental Price Prediction Model | CSCI 303 - Data Science</h3>
    <p>This project involved predicting rental prices for properties in the Denver Metro area using machine learning. I used features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood data to build predictive models.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Methods:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Preprocessed real estate data from Zillow using Python.</li>
        <li>Built and evaluated models using Linear Regression and Random Forest.</li>
        <li>Visualized data and model performance with Matplotlib and Seaborn.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Results:</strong> Achieved an R-squared of 0.799 with Linear Regression, demonstrating the model's ability to capture rental price trends. The Random Forest model performed slightly less well with an R-squared of 0.654.</p>
    <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
    <pre><code>
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv("denver_rentals.csv")
X = data[['sqft', 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'neighborhood']]
y = data['price']

# Train a Random Forest model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X)
mse = mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)

    <h3>Blood Alcohol Content Dynamics Model | MATH 310 - Mathematical Modeling</h3>
    <p>This project involved modeling the reduction of blood alcohol content (BAC) over time using two different metabolic pathways: zeroth-order kinetics and Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics. I compared these models to understand the dynamics of alcohol metabolism.</p>
    <p><strong>Key Methods:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented both zeroth-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics in MATLAB.</li>
        <li>Performed sensitivity analysis on model parameters like initial BAC and elimination rates.</li>
        <li>Validated model output against physiological benchmarks.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Key Results:</strong> Identified the more realistic model based on metabolic pathway comparison. Proposed a combined two-phase dynamic system to simulate both absorption and elimination stages more accurately.</p>
    <h4>Code Snippet:</h4>
    <pre><code>
% Zeroth-order kinetics for BAC elimination
function dBACdt = zeroOrderBAC(t, BAC, k)
