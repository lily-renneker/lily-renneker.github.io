      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Lily Renneker and welcome to my project portfolio!</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from Colorado School of Mines with a B.S. in Computational and Applied Mathematics, and I’m now pursuing my M.S. in Applied Mathematics with a focus in data science at the University of Colorado Denver. My goal is to apply data-driven methods and mathematical modeling to tackle real-world challenges from finance, to biotech, to math education.</p>
      <p>During undergrad, I worked on a variety of projects with many different applications, from mathematical biology to climate change to finance prediction models. In the summer between my junior and senior year, as a Managed Application Services Intern at RSM US LLP, I built data automation tools within Microsoft Dynamics 365, reducing processing errors and streamlining batch tracking.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, I’m especially motivated to contribute to biotechnology and personalized medicine, using data science to improve outcomes for underrepresented communities. I’m also passionate about making mathematics more inclusive and accessible through research and education.</p>
      <p>Beyond academics and research, I’ve been involved with the Society of Women Engineers, Society for Women in Mathematics, and OSTEM. These communities have been vital in helping me advocate for diversity in STEM and connect with others who share my values.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Developed and deployed an <strong>end-to-end batch job tracking system</strong> in Microsoft Dynamics 365 (D365 F&O), leveraging <strong>X++</strong> to query and log batch job metadata (e.g., status, start/finish times, errors, retry counts) into a custom table. Implemented a scheduled service job to monitor batch lifecycle and automatically flag failed jobs using <code>BatchHeader</code> and <code>BatchJobHistory</code> tables.
    </li>

    <li>
      Designed a <strong>low-code monitoring dashboard in Power Apps</strong> connected to the D365 database via the Dataverse connector.

    <h3>Data Science & Machine Learning Project: Statistical Analysis of Chess Games</h3>
<p>This project explored over 20,000 chess games from the Lichess dataset to analyze gameplay trends, optimize data storage with SQL, and develop machine learning models to predict game outcomes. It was completed in collaboration with Sierra Bohren and Emmy Dupree-Henry for the CSCI 403 course.</p>

<p><strong>Project Scope:</strong> We designed a normalized PostgreSQL database schema, cleaned and queried complex data, and built two predictive models — a feedforward neural network and a random forest classifier — to forecast game results based on player ratings, number of turns, and opening played.</p>

<p><strong>Key Tools and Methods:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong> SQL, Python, R, PostgreSQL, scikit-learn, tidyverse</li>
  <li><strong>Techniques:</strong> Database normalization (BCNF), data cleaning, EDA, neural networks, random forest classification, model evaluation (accuracy, ROC AUC), one-hot encoding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Random Forest model achieved 68.6% accuracy, outperforming the neural network (64.4%)</li>
  <li>Player rating and game opening were the most important predictors of game outcome</li>
  <li>Draws were the most difficult to predict, highlighting limitations in available features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Highlighted SQL Query:</strong> Determining the most popular openings used over 100 times:</p>
<pre><code>
WITH opening_counts AS (
  SELECT opening_name, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM chess
  GROUP BY opening_name
)
SELECT opening_name, count
FROM opening_counts
WHERE count > 100;
</code></pre>

<h4>Visualizations:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Factor importance plot for random forest classification</li>
  <li>Confusion matrix heatmap</li>
  <li>Bar charts comparing average turns and win rates by opening</li>
</ul>
<img src="images/chess_games_analysis.png" alt="Chess Game Feature Importance" width="600" />

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This project demonstrated how structured data engineering and machine learning can reveal underlying patterns in chess strategy. While predictive performance was moderate, the project laid the groundwork for more advanced modeling, such as incorporating player history or move sequences in future iterations.</p>
